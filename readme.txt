One result of this extreme flexibility, is that it becomes difficult to provide "step 1-2-3" guides for the plugin, as these steps won't necessarily apply to all of our customers' needs. For every "case" we provide as an example, we will end up leaving out dozens of other scenarios that WP-Client would be perfect for. We hope that the development path we are taking will make the plugin even easier to use going forward.
